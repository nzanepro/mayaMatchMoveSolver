Multi-Camera and Object Solve
-----------------------------

Using mmSolver to solve multiple cameras; solving a shot camera,
witness camera and object track. We do not need to have shared 2D
tracking information in order to solve using multiple cameras. The
demonstration also shows the Smooth Keyframes tool, used to smooth an
animation curve then re-solve. A single frame camera line-up for
multiple cameras is also shown.

This video uses mmSolver v0.2.1.
